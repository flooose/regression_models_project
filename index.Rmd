In this publication I will look at the `mtcars` data set and compare
manual and automatic transmissions.

## Examining the Data

```{R, cache=T}
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
```

The column corresponding to the transmission type is `am`. We convert
its type from a `double` to a [@rhelp, `factor`].

```{R, cache=T}
summary(mtcars)
typeof(mtcars$am)
mtcars$automaticTransmission <- as.factor(mtcars$am)
```

```{R, cache=T}
g <- ggplot(data=mtcars)
g <- g + geom_point() + aes(x=automaticTransmission, y=mpg)
g
```
